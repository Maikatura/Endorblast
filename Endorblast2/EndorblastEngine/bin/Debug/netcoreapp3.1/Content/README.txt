Hi before you edit files here remember if you edit something other than textures could lead to a false ban.

Most of the time its your own fault for triggering that and will mostly not unban you since we have warned you!
If you have edit it we will inform you ingame that it could lead to a false ban.


Note that this does not include changing images to how you like. 
Just note that only you will be able to see it if you change it.
So please dont complain about it on our forum :)

Btw if you read this before release or got it form an old build please update your game :)
